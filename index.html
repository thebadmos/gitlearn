            <h2>13/05/23: Spatulas</h2>
            <p>
                Yesterday I went to the store and got some much-needed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XbCWmY0eqY">spatulas!</a> (What better way to<br> say I love myself than to buy myself a spatula?)

            <h2>14/05/23: Cookie Monster Cupcakes</h2>
            <p>My favorite cartoon character is Cookie Monster, and my favorite dessert is <br>
                cupcakes, so Cookie Monster cupcakes are the best of both worlds.
            </p>

            <p>Did you know? Cookie Monster once said, <q>Sometimes me think what is love, and<br> then me think love is what last cookie is for. Me give up the last cookie for<br> you.</q> I wonder if the same applies for cupcakes? (If so, I don't think I can <br>ever love ANYONE!)
